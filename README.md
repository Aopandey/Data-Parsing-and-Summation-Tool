# What is this Project?

This C++ program reads data from "input.txt", calculates the sum of three integers per line, then uses this sum to replicate a subsequent text string, outputting the result to "output.txt". It demonstrates file I/O, string parsing with std::stringstream, and array manipulation, with a makefile for easy compilation and execution.
